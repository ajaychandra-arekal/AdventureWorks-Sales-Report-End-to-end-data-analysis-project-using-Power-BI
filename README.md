# AdventureWorks Sales Report end-to-end data analysis project using PowerBI

Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Business Intelligence solution for Adventure Works Cycles, a fictional global manufacturer of cycling equipment. The goal was to transform raw sales and returns data into actionable insights that help stakeholders make informed decisions around sales performance, product profitability, and customer behavior.

The dashboard was developed as part of Udemy Power BI Desktop course.

# Business Questions Explored
- What are the key KPIs for sales, revenue, profit, and return rate?
- How has revenue changed over time, and are there seasonal trends?
- Which products or categories are most profitable and which have the highest return rates?
- How does sales performance vary by region?
- Who are the high-value customers, and what are their demographic profiles?
- What strategies can be informed by the data to improve sales and reduce returns?


# Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop – Data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard development
- Power Query  – Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation (ETL)
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures and calculated columns
- Microsoft Excel / CSV – Source data files


# Project Phases and Key Learnings

# Data Acquisition & Transformation

Process: Connected multiple CSV files covering sales, returns, customers, products, and calendar data. Cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query (e.g., type conversions, column splitting, handling missing values).

Learning: Gained hands-on experience in Power Query for efficient ETL and ensuring data quality for reliable analysis.


# Data Modeling

Process: Designed a star schema data model linking fact tables (Sales, Returns) to dimension tables (Customer, Product, Calendar, Territory). Built one-to-many relationships to support accurate filtering and slicing.

Learning: Strengthened understanding of data modeling best practices, cardinality, and filter context for scalable and high-performing models.


# DAX Calculations

Process: Developed calculated columns and measures including Total Revenue, Profit, Return Rate, Year-over-Year Growth, and Profit Margin.

Learning: Advanced skills in DAX, including use of time-intelligence functions and row context manipulation for dynamic, reusable metrics.


# Interactive Dashboard Design

Process: Built a multi-page Power BI dashboard with sections for executive summary, product insights, geographic trends, and customer analysis. Included various visuals like cards, line and bar charts, maps, and tables with interactive slicers and drill-throughs.

Learning: Developed a strong foundation in designing clean, user-friendly, and interactive dashboards that communicate insights clearly to a variety of users.


# Key Insights
- Product Performance: Bikes generated the most revenue and profit. Accessories had high sales volume but lower value per unit.
- Regional Trends: The United States led in total sales, while Australia showed a higher average revenue per customer.
- Seasonality: Sales peaked in December, indicating holiday-driven demand. Fluctuations during mid-2020 suggest external market influences.
- Customer Segments: Identified high-value customer groups based on demographic variables like education level and occupation.
- Returns Analysis: Shorts had a significantly higher return rate, highlighting a potential product quality or customer expectation issue.
